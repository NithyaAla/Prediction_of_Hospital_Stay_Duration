# Prediction_of_Hospital_Stay_Duration
Healthcare organizations are facing growing pressure to enhance patient care and provide better facilities. It is possible to significantly improve the quality of care by leveraging data and extracting more value from it.

The ability to predict the duration of stay at the time of admission enables hospitals to manage resources efficiently and handle emergencies effectively. This project aims to accurately predict the duration of stay of a patient during the time of admission depending on various factors like the age, severity of illness, type of injury, hospital region etc.

This project is based on the research paper “Analysis of length of hospital stay using electronic health records: A statistical and data mining approach” published by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information.
